Here we are passing various information of students
and displaying them. On doing so we make two components
one to display introduction and another to display academics 
related information.


---> destructuring makes code simpler and easy to read
---> passing data as props is crucial
---> try making components as short as possible
---> try making multiple compponents
---> A components is nothing but a function that takes 
     props and returns us UI, so make components when we 
     have to use particular type of code again and again.
